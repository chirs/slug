## Slug

A scheme interpreter in javascript.

Inspired by Peter Norvig's lis.py and John McCarthy's [History of Lisp](http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/lisp/lisp.html)

Slug is named after Steve "Slug" Russell, the person who realized that eval could serve as an interpreter for LISP, and then promptly wrote that interpreter.

(He also created Spacewar!, one of the first computer games.)
